A react project that demonstrates fundamental building blocks of react ecosystem (component, props, states, router).

## Dependencies intallation

`$ npm install -g react-router-dom`

## Start playing with the App:

`$ yarn start` 



## Approach:

One single `component` (`ListBooks`) cloned into 03 to handle 03 shelves (read, want to read, currently reading). 

 ## Notice:

* Both Chrome and Firefox compatible

* One unique function to move from shelf to an another and to create shelf on books that have been found

* Shelf migration is persistent after page refresh

* Uncounter some errors when creating shelf sometimes:
